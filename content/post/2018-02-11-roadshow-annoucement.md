Learn how to build your robot project in hours not months with Ubiquity Robotics Magni at one of our roadshow events!

> ![Magni/Loki](/img/MagniLoki2.jpg)

Building robot applications is hard, mainly because you have to spend months and years building something that has payload capability, mobility, navigation and a compute infrastructure and you have to do this before you can even build the cool cocktail waiter application or follow me robot. The hacker dojo gave rise to a group that wanted to solve this problem and they built Magni, a robot based on open source software that has all this working out of the box. 

We are going to talk about the Magni platform, how you can use it, how we got started and how we can all make use of Magni to do the cool things that we want to do. We may even touch on our little robot - Loki - as well!

### Times and Locations

We will be at the Seattle Robotics Society Meeting on February 17th at 10AM.

Then we are going to the ROS Seattle Meetup on the 17th at 6:00PM.

<!-- WE SHOULD DO A TABLE HERE INSTEAD -->

### When

The event is on Tuesday 23rd of January 2018, the event will start at 5pm although the doors will be open from around 4pm. The presentation will run for about 30-40 minutes but there will be lots of time afterward to ask questions and try out our robots. We don't expect to close the doors until 7pm.

### Other information

The event is free, just bring a love of robots.
